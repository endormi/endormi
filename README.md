# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

###### *Software Developer/Engineer*

Check out my website at [endormi.io](https://endormi.io).

Highly passionate about Development, Security, Infrastructure, Privacy, Automation, and more.

I'm inherently curious and constantly exploring different technologies, with a strong emphasis on privacy.

I've thoroughly enjoyed creating these projects, and I'm delighted if others find them useful.

If you find value in any of the projects I've created, you can support me by funding using these platforms and/or giving a star for the projects.
